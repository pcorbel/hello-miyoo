## âœ… Setup the hello-miyoo app

Once you have successfully installed MinUI, you can now install the hello-miyoo app.

* On the SD card, copy the `app` folder content (should be `app.py`, `auto.sh` and `parasyte` folder) in the `/.userdata/miyoomini/` folder.

## ðŸ¤” How is it working?

The `auto.sh` script is executed by MinUI at startup time. It will load all necessary libraries from Parasyte, then will execute the `app.py` file, which is a Python script using the PyGame library.

You can now create your own apps using Python and PyGame, and share them with the community !
